MissingOutputException in rule some_other_rule in file "/Users/samuelgair/Desktop/BA_code/snakemake_fun/workflow/Snakefile", line 3:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
second.txt (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
