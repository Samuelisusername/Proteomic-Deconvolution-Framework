MissingOutputException in rule create_samples_and_sig_matrix in file "/Users/samuelgair/Desktop/BA_code/snakemake_fun/workflow/Snakefile", line 3:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
imputed_sigmatrix.txt (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Removing output files of failed job create_samples_and_sig_matrix since they might be corrupted:
healthy_sample_imputed.txt, real_fracs.tsv, real_coarse_fracs.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
